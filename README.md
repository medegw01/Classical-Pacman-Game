- #### About game:
   In the game, there are boulders:department_store: which usual corresponds to the level. For instance, level one has a single boulder, level two
 has 2 and so on. The pacman cannot go through boulders but can go through thw wall of the screen and come out from the adjacent wall.
 The reverse is the case for the ghosts. The game automatically changes level when the current level is completed. The score is displayed i the lower
 left corner of screen
 
  To end the game, one either types Q or let sny ghost touch the pacman. The non zero velocity of the pacman is always equal to that of the
 the ghost. However, if the pacman stops, the ghost moves with a slow constant velocity.
